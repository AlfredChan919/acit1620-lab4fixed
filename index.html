                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Badminton is one of the fastest pace sports in the world. To compete at the highest level, it requires precise hand-eye coordination alongside a fast reaction, proper technique, stamina, and strength.</p>
                <p>With birdies capable of flying up to 500km/h, one must wield a powerful weapon on the court. Rackets come in all shapes, lengths, and sizes. Head-heavy rackets create higher torque and smashing power, but potentially lacks speed and power if the wielder lacks technique. A balanced racket is a jack of all trades, in speed, control, and power; However, such a racket does not excel in any stat. Lastly we have the head-light rackets. Not usually preferred by many, what they lack in power they make up with their speed and agility at returning and producing shots.</p>
                <p>Arguably more important than the racket are the court shoes. Designed to sustain the constant force from lateral pushes on the court, it supports your feet from sliding. The midsoles are innovated to absorb and release stored kinetic energy so that you can jump higher and play for longer. Most shoes are made with a non-marking rubber sole. As for Yonex, a well-reknowned badminton brand, implemenets their power cushion technology into every shoe.</p>
                <p>As much as you can adjust personal factors for optimal performance on the court. The court environment itself can determine one's victory or defeat. Since everyone is mostly looking up to the ceiling for most of the game, lighting is a crucial factor to account for. Angled downlighting is most optimal, with a dark colored backdrop from the ceiling to contrast the neon-yellow/white birdies. Conversely, the floor plays a vital role in the health of players, along with effective playstyles. A slippery court can cause rolled ankles, while a hard wooden floor can cause damage to the player over time from all the jumping. An optimal court environment would be a hollow flooring, with a cushion mat underneath the court for support, and a rubber surface so there is no slipping when it is paired with the court shoes.</p>

                <h2>The Game</h2>
                <p>Singles or doubles, methodical or aggressive, fast-paced or slow-paced; There are many strategies to play the game.</p>
                <p>Professional singles players take a more methodical approach for their victory. They tend to wear down their opponent while seeking for a weakness in their defense to exploit. Upon doing so, they will pull out their ultimate attack, the jump smash, to try and secure the point. Another method is to constantly fluctuate the pace of the game, which can catch other players off-guard. All in all, singles badminton is a slower chess-like take on the game of badminton.</p>
                <p>Aggressive, fast-paced, tactical. Those are just a few words to describe the game of doubles badminton. Requiring mind-reading-like synergy with your partner, teams must constantly swap between attack and defense. Since the players are already covering most of the court, the birdie is exchanged back and forth extremely fast. Intense rallies are capable of going over 100 shots just for a single point. Both you and your partner must cover each others flaws to succeed.</p>
